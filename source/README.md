# Source files directory

All the files that make the main app work will be kept here

This is a terminal app that will use a graph and BFS to search

game recommendations from a pre-sorted list with ratings included

the user will be asked to choose by genre, and receive a ranked list of 

recommendations from that genre. 

To keep things simple, while the ratings are sourced from MetaCritic, they are user scores because

user scores are on a 10 scale and I wanted to keep things simple. This is simply a concept project.
