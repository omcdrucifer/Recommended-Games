###### meant to remove this from the public git, deleted it from everywhere

This is just going to be an abridged version of the original todos since I have figured out a path and am now typing it up 
a second time. 

Portfolio Project 2 is a Recommendation Engine.

I am working on an engine that will give video game recommendations based on genre and rating

I am using a graph/vertex/bfs approach

This will also be a terminal application

To Do:
    Build the vertex, graph, BFS script (in progress)
    Build the script to assemble the graph (or just add it to the graph file)
    Build the script to handle user input and interactivity (this will be independent of the other files)
    Possibly build a file to manage any print dialog
    Design UX
Have Done:
    Created a graph.py file that has the logic for vertices, graphs, and bfs
    Created a Git Repo and connected it to git
    Made the initial upload, deleted Todos
