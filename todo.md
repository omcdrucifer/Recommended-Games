Portfolio Project # 2

Some kind of recommendation engine that explores a certain topic (i.e. movies, restaurants, travel, books, etc)

Must incorporate concepts learned in previous lessons:
    Data Structures:
        Graphs
        Trees
        Linked Lists

    Algorithms for searching:
        A*
        Heuristics (see above)
        naive searching

Consider user experience. This is a Python project so it will most likely be a terminal app
much like the previous, albeit a bit more complex.

ToDos:
    Conceptualize a data structure
    Determine the search method and algorithms to use
    Build out the code structure
    Think of ux
    Set up a new Git repo
    Version control


Notes:

I am heavily leaning towards a video game search database. I am considering whether to limit it to searching by genre or if I want to be able to sub-divide
by MetaCritic rating. 

In light of this I then need to narrow down between using a linked list and node tree, or if I want to try and build some kind of weighted graph.

The question becomes if I want to use a binary search tree, or if I want to use a more complex tree with a more complex method like A*

A Euclidian Heuristic may be a better approach if I decide to go with a weighted graph, a LL and Node Tree could work with bst.
