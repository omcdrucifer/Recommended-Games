# Source files directory

All the files that make the main app work will be kept here

This is a terminal app that will use a graph and BFS to search

game recommendations from a pre-sorted list with ratings included

the user will be asked to choose by genre, and receive a ranked list of 

recommendations from that genre. 

To keep things simple, while the ratings are sourced from MetaCritic, they are user scores because

user scores are on a 10 scale and I wanted to keep things simple. This is simply a concept project.

The app is now feature complete. Aside from aesthetic improvements, it does what I wanted it to.

This is just a concept project, so I kept the dataset small. The graph holds 5 genres, with 5 titles each.

The dict that holds the blurbs contains short blurbs for each of the 25 titles. I put my best effor in with 
controlling the format of the returned print statements.

I plan to apply some of this to an upcoming personal portfolio project I am thinking up currently.
