This is just going to be an abridged version of the original todos since I have figured out a path and am now typing it up 
a second time. 

Portfolio Project 2 is a Recommendation Engine.

I am working on an engine that will give video game recommendations based on genre and rating

Ratings are source from MetaCritic. I'm using user scores rather than review scores since they are 10 scale. 

I am using a graph/vertex/bfs approach

This will also be a terminal application

To Do:
    Possibly build a file to manage any print dialog
    Design UX

Have Done:
    Created a graph.py file that has the logic for vertices, graphs, and bfs
    Created a Git Repo and connected it to git
    Made the initial upload 
    Build the script to assemble the graph
    Started the script to handle user interaction
    Build the script to handle user input and interactivity (this will be independent of the other files)

built a helper function load_data in data.py to handle assembling the graph based on the dict
